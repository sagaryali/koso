  product_description:
    "A project management tool for remote engineering teams that combines async communication with real-time collaboration. Built for teams of 5-50 people who need to ship fast without drowning in meetings. Key differentiator: context-aware task assignments that surface relevant docs, code, and conversations when you pick up a task.",
  principles: [
    "Async-first: every action should have a non-blocking path",
    "Context over notifications: show relevant information, not alerts",
    "Keyboard-driven: power users should never need a mouse",
  ],
};
